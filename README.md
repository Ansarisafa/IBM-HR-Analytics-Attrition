# 🧠 IBM HR Analytics – Employee Attrition & Performance

This project aims to analyze and visualize key HR metrics using IBM’s HR dataset to understand employee attrition patterns and improve organizational retention strategies.

---

## 📌 Objective

To identify the key factors contributing to employee attrition using exploratory data analysis and build a decision tree model to help predict and understand which employees are more likely to leave the company.

---

## 📊 Tools & Technologies Used

- **Python**  
- **Google Colab**  
- **Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn**  
- **Scikit-learn (DecisionTreeClassifier)**  
- **PowerPoint ,Canva(for report generation)**

## 📁 Dataset

- 📂 Source: [IBM HR Analytics Dataset – Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset)
- 📈 Features: Age, JobSatisfaction, Attrition, MonthlyIncome, OverTime, JobRole, Gender, EnvironmentSatisfaction

---

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis

Key visual insights:
- Attrition distribution across departments
- Impact of OverTime on attrition
- Job satisfaction and its relationship with retention
- Correlation heatmap between numeric features

---

## 🧮 Correlation Analysis

- Conducted heatmap visualization
- Found key correlations like:
  - Positive correlation: OverTime & Attrition
  - Negative correlation: JobSatisfaction & Attrition

---

## 🌳 Machine Learning Model

- **Model Used:** Decision Tree Classifier  
- **Goal:** Predict attrition status (Yes/No)
- **Output:** Classification report + Visualized decision tree

---

## 📌 Insights

- OverTime is one of the most significant drivers of attrition.
- Employees with low job involvement and satisfaction are more likely to leave.
- Clear visualization helped in understanding the patterns affecting employee behavior.
